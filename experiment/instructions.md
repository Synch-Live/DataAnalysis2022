Welcome to Synch.Live. Please choose a hat and put it on your head and keep it there for the remainder of the game. We have shower caps available. If you have any bags or belongings, please leave them on one of the chairs. If you have a phone, please put it on the chair with the belongings, as no phones are allowed in the game.

Take a moment to notice each other’s hats - everyone’s lights are flashing on and off randomly. Your challenge today is to see if you can figure out - as a group - how to walk in such a way that all the lights in the group flash on and off at the same time. The more you move together, as a group, the more all the lights will flash on and off at the same time. You have no individual control over your own hat lights. You can only solve this as a group. You will know you've won the game when your blue lights turn rainbow.

Here are the rules: no talking, no touching, and keep walking. The lights in the corners mark the boundary of the play area. Please stay within this area. 

There is no right or wrong way to play Synch.Live as long as you follow the rules. We’re excited to see how your group meets this challenge.

Right now, I would like each of you to spread out. As soon as you hear the sound of the bell, start walking!
