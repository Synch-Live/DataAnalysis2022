0,A_2,No,No not really I'm not that sure of what happened and why it did,0,1
1,A_2,Neutral,,0,1
2,A_2,Yes,Walking in the same direction,0,1
3,A_2,No,I think that when more people move in the same direction at the same time something happened I don't think a circle would have worked,0,1
4,A_2,Yes,Yes,0,1
5,A_2,No,No,0,1
6,A_2,Yes,"Somewhat, but when we synced I wanted to continue to experiment to see if we could I sync",0,1
7,A_3,Yes,"Yes as we started moving together in a circular motion, the lights started going on and off in sync",1,0

9,A_3,Yes,Following the person in front and matching their pace,1,0
10,A_3,Yes,Eventually yes,1,0
11,A_3,Yes,It seemed like the flashing was beginning to synchronise,1,0
12,A_3,Yes,The lights seem to be aligning so carried on,1,0
13,A_3,Yes,I believe that the above strategies worked and  also that moving in a circle had a positive impact,1,0
14,A_3,Yes,Yes,1,0
15,A_3,Neutral,,1,0
16,A_3,No,No,1,0
17,A_4,No,A little bit – the blinking synced with nearby people – but I wasn't sure it was working,1,0
18,A_4,Yes,"Changing direction, following others",1,0
19,A_4,No,Not really,1,0
20,A_4,No,Not really – perhaps keeping in pace and trying to find a way of forming a pattern but I was surprised when lights changed,1,0
21,A_4,Yes,I thought as we looked at each other the hats lit up,1,0
22,A_4,No,No,1,0

30,A_5,Yes,Possibly constant spacing and speed,0,1
31,A_5,No,No,0,1

33,A_6,Yes,Yes,1,0
34,A_6,Yes,Proximity to others,1,0
35,A_6,Yes,"When we started walking in a circle it seemed like some people were syncing up, especially if close",1,0

39,A_6,Yes,"When all lights was synched,  knew we were doing right thing",1,0
40,A_6,Yes,Yes,1,0
41,A_6,Yes,I realised that changing the colour of the perimeter lights weren't working because no lights on the hats were in sync When we started walking in a circle the lights on the hats started syncing so I thought by looking at another person would sync the hats When all of us were walking in a circle all the hats synced  so I realised this strategy worked,1,0
42,A_6,Yes,To find the link between when hats linked up got me to join the circle myself Also followed other peoples ideas to walk in a circle,1,0

44,A_7,No,No I didn't figure it out,0,1

46,A_7,No,Not really no,0,1
47,A_7,No,No,0,1
48,A_7,Yes,Vaguely and it felt team work was much effective in rocking back and forth as a group,0,1
49,A_7,Yes,"Yes, most of the time",0,1
50,A_7,Neutral,No There is no positive or negative feedback  At one point I thought it might be working when we were nodding close to each other in a synchronised way but we couldn't be sure Most of the time we were just moving randomly,0,1
51,A_7,Yes,At some point yes I think it is a motion driven system,0,1
52,A_8,No,"No, hardly",0,0
53,A_8,No,"Not necessarily, it was a trial and error approach",0,0
54,A_8,No,I tried to monitor patterns with the lights but it was very hard to discern what made them synchronise,0,0
55,A_8,Yes,"Smaller steps, spaced apart, group clusters",0,0
56,A_8,Neutral,"A bit, I think it worked when we separated a little bit",0,0
57,A_8,No,No because I didn't know which  strategy actually caused the hat to turn into rainbow,0,0
58,A_9,Yes,I see when people close to each other lights flash at the same time,0,0
59,A_9,Neutral,No but harmony and circle worked,0,0
60,A_9,No,No,0,0
61,A_9,Neutral,Yes - none,0,0
62,A_9,Neutral,Circle seemed effective at first but then theorised that flashing is random and that I may as well do my own thing/try as many patterns as possible,0,0

100,B_7,Yes,Not until starting to walk in a line behind others,1,0
101,B_7,Yes,Yes,1,0
102,B_7,Neutral,Not to start But the lights helped,1,0
103,B_7,Yes,Yes – going closer and doing the same as each other – going in a circle,1,0
104,B_7,No,Not really,1,0
105,B_8,Yes,Sometimes the lights were in sync until someone broke the chain,0,0
106,B_8,Neutral,partly – circling seemed to,0,0
107,B_8,No,No,0,0
108,B_8,Yes,"The standing still and looking at pairs, that worked well, but there were people who seemed to just walk randomly and break the chain",0,0

116,B_9,Yes,Leading by example,1,0
117,B_9,Yes,Walking along the same path seemed to work I was trying to figure out how they would have designed the game and how the tech worked,1,0
118,B_9,No,No Was happy to follow the group to see if it worked,1,0
119,B_9,No,Tight circle but otherwise not really,1,0
120,B_9,Yes,I think imitation and trying to listen to nonverbal guesses/ body language from other people was helpful,1,0
